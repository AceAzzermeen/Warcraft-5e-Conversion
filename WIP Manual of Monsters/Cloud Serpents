## Cloud Serpents
A cloud serpent is a long, sinuous serpent-like dragon native to Pandaria. It is continually born aloft by the winds, eternally swimming through the air. While it is considered a dragon, it bears no connection to the dragonflights and while intelligent, it is closer to a particularly cunning animal than the keen intellect of a true dragon.

***Fragile Balance.*** While the elder cloud serpents are as deadly a creature as any that exists on Azeroth, the eggs and hatchlings are almost paradoxically weak. Their young can only be found in specific isolated locations and need to be fiercely protected by their guardians.

***Power of the Storm.*** According to myth, the first cloud serpent was born from a lake set aflame by the lightning of the Thunder King. Ever since, the cloud serpent have had a special connection to the storm. As they grow in age and power, they become more inured to its effects and eventually some are able to bring forth their inner storm through their breath or their mere presence.

***Order of the Cloud Serpent.*** Thousands of years ago, a young pandaren girl found an injured hatchling. Though cloud serpents were feared at that time as violent and aggressive beasts, Jiang chose to care for and raise the cloud serpent Lo into an honored companion who went on to save her life from a troll and later proved their worth as deadly companions to the pandaren defenders.

Jiang then went on to found the Order of the Cloud Serpent, an order of flying pandaren warriors. While wild cloud serpents cannot be tamed to act as mounts, when one is raised from an egg to adolescence, they can prove to be eternally loyal beasts.

***Ancient Powers.*** While most cloud serpents who survive to adulthood become powerful creatures in their own right, something more is needed to push them to the power of an ancient cloud serpent. These creatures almost always have a connection to some powerful being or place.

***Multicolored.*** There are five primary colors found among the cloud serpents. While each has different attitudes and associations among pandaren folklore, but there are no real differences in their abilities. The five kinds of cloud serpents are:
___
- **Azure.** These creatures are associated as being harbingers of good fortune. 
- **Crimson.** These cloud serpents are given to flights of fancy, often striking out on a whim for seemingly random journeys, sometimes for days at a time.
- **Golden.** Golden cloud serpents are very rare and a sight to behold, considered a national treasure.
- **Jade.** The most common kind of cloud serpent, jade serpents are particularly quick to violence when threatened.
- **Onyx.** Among the most rare of cloud serpents, these stealthy creatures are aggressive and deadly.

### A Cloud Serpent's Lair
While younger cloud serpents are known to be free-spirited wanderers, ancient cloud serpents usually stick to a single location, though their territory still encompasses several square miles.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the cloud serpent takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
- The cloud serpent causes a thick mist to blanket a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 10 minutes or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. The cloud serpent can see through this mist.
- The cloud serpent changes the weather in the area, either causing a thunderstorm or calming one. Treat this as if the *control weather* spell had been cast, with the precipitation and wind stages increasing or decreasing by one step each on each of the cloud serpent's turns until it reaches stage 1 or stage 5. Once the stages are 4 or above, it is considered a thunderstorm. Extreme weather conditions are described on page 110 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
- The cloud serpent covers itself in a sheath of protective wind. It is immune to all damage and effects but can take no offensive actions until its next lair action.
- The cloud serpent causes a strong gust of wind to burst froth from its body. This takes the form of either a 60-radius sphere centered on it or a 120 foot long by 15 foot wide line. Creatures in the area must make a DC 21 Strength save or be pushed 20 feet away from the cloud serpent.

#### Regional Effects
The territory of an ancient cloud serpent is changed by its inner storm, which creates on or more of the following effects:
- The air in a 6 mile radius crackles with static electricity. Large amounts of metal can invite lightning strikes.
- The cloud serpent can change the shape and color of clouds on a whim.
- An eternal thunderstorm rages in a 6 mile radius. Alternatively, the weather in the area is eternally peaceful.

If the cloud serpent dies, the effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

> ##### Variant: Heavenly Cloud Serpent
> A very rare few cloud serpents possess a deep connection to the spirits. These heavenly creatures have an inner white-gold light that shines through the gaps in their scales as well as their eyes, mouth, horns, and claws. They possess the following traits:
> ___
> - ***Illumination.*** A heavenly cloud serpent hatchling sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light an additional 5 feet. These ranges increases to 20 feet for a young cloud serpent, 30 feet for an adult cloud serpent, and to 60 feet for an ancient cloud serpent.
> - ***Aura of Peace and Hope.*** The cloud serpent and allied creatures within the area of the cloud serpent's bright illumination cannot be charmed or frightened as long as it is conscious.
> - ***Innate Spellcasting.*** A heavenly cloud serpent can cast certain spells innately. Their spellcasting ability is Charisma, and they gain innate spells at each age category: <br> **Hatchling.** At will: *dancing lights*. 1/day: *bless* <br> **Young.** 1/day: *aura of vitality*, *divine favor*, *lesser restoration* <br> **Adult.** 1/day: *aura of life*, *aura of purity* <br> **Ancient.** 1/day: *banishment*. 1/week: *raise dead*

> ##### Variant: Thundering Cloud Serpent
> Some cloud serpents manifest their inner storm earlier and more powerfully than other cloud serpents. These creatures crackle with lightning and have the ***Lightning Absorption*** and ***Static Skin*** traits. 
> 
> ***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the cloud serpent is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of Hit Points equal to the lightning damage dealt.
> 
> ***Static Skin.*** The cloud serpent deals an additional 3 (1d6) lightning damage with its melee attacks and creatures that hit the cloud serpent with a melee attack take 3 (1d6) lightning damage. The cloud serpent also has disadvantage on Stealth checks, except when in a thundercloud, where it has advantage instead.
> 
> A thundering cloud serpent has an altered Challenge Rating:
> ___
> - **Hatchling.** CR 1 (200 XP)
> - **Young.** CR 7 (2,900 XP)
> - **Adult.** CR 15 (13,000 XP)
