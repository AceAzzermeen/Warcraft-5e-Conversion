## Elementals
Elementals are as ageless as they are unchanging; volatile beings of raw elemental power, manifested in physical form. Since the early days of creation, as life hurdled through the cosmos and manifested itself upon countless worlds, the most common primordial form of life has been the elementals -- who now populate nearly every world spanning across the great dark beyond, nourishing themselves off of the energies within.

***Bound to the Elemental Plane.*** On Azeroth, as the titanic Keepers saw to the ordering of the world, they found the elementals wreaking havoc under the corrupting influence of the Old Gods. As a safeguard, to protect their intended new denizens of the planet from such a destructive force, the Keepers constructed the Elemental Plane as a prison in which the elementals could be locked away, free to roam at their own behest. In their absence, the Keepers could tend to their task at hand; settling the natural order of Azeroth.

The Elemental Plane is divided into four interlinked regions, each existing within its own pocket dimension as a representation of its associated element: The Abyssal Maw, domain of water; Deepholm, domain of earth; the Firelands, domain of fire; and Skywall, domain of air.

***An Eternity of Conflict.*** Though the domains within the Elemental Plane are intended to be sealed off, none of them accessible from the others, the elementals have never ceased their endless strife with one another. By what means they can, whether by breaching the walls of their domain to invade another or by taking their conflict to the physical plane with the help of mortal hands, the elementals are quick to clash as they meet -- sometimes waging battles of titanic proportions.

***The Ordering of Elements.*** Though elementals are chaotic and violent by nature, some more so than others, they themselves follow a strict ordering of power within their elemental domain.

Above all other sits the Elemental Lords; beings of untamed power, whose sum can be considered even larger than most else existing within their realm. They hold power over their domain within the Elemental Plane, subjugating lesser elementals to carry out their bidding. It is said that if magic drawing power from the Elemental Plane is cast in the presence of the Elemental Lord governing that particular elemental domain, it may well fall to said Lord to take control of the spell at their own whim.

Carrying out the bidding of the Elemental Lords are their lieutenants. While nowhere near as powerful as their respective Lord, it is not uncommon for an elemental lieutenant to wield both great power and agency in carrying out their master's bidding.

***Elemental Nature.*** An elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Air Elemental
Taking form as a swirling storm, or a billowing cloud given faint humanoid shape, an air elemental holds command of wind and weather. Fast and silent, it strikes out by enveloping its foes in a blinding whirlwind to seize the upper hand.

### Water Elemental
A favoured companion among mages, human mages in particular, a water elemental is near impossible to discern while underwater. If able, it often attempts to deal with threats by luring them along into the water -- dragging them from there into the murky depths.
