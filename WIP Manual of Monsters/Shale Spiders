## Shale Spider
Shale spiders are durable diggers, native to the elemental plane of Deepholm. They possess a tenacity and ferocity not shown in many other elementals; as one will often fight until it is utterly and entirely torn asunder.

***Stone Nuisance.*** The spiders sometimes find their way out of Deepholm, emerging onto the surface. A newly emerged shale spider is fairly harmless, keeping reclusive while it tries to adapt to its new environment. Once it has, however, it sets out to hunt -- often with a voracious hunger.

***Swarmers.*** Above all, the shale spiders are notorious swarmers. They'll often work together to take down their prey. Sometimes, a single shale spider will pretend to be alone, while its kin lays in wait for an opportunity to strike.

***Elemental Nature.*** The shale spider doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
