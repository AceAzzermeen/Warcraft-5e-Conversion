## Elemental Mote
Elemental motes are the least of the elemental creatures. Typically they act as servitors to the higher elementals or as assistants to the creatures who summon them.

***???.*** [Explanation that they lack the energy and substance of proper elementals, but their loose composition in comparison to proper elementals means that their energy can leak into similarly aligned creatures. It takes a strong connection for most of the motes. For example, a mote of air wouldn't benefit a flying creature just because of that, the creature would need to be deeply connected to the sky/air.]

> ##### By Your Powers Combined
> When multiple elemental motes work together, they can combine to form into a greater elemental. If at least four elemental motes of the same type arrange in a 10 foot square and spend their turns this round using their action and movement to focus, they can combine to form another creature. This creature is at full health and has no conditions no matter the status of the motes. The kind of creature formed depends on the motes involved:
> Mote Type|Creature Formed
> ---------|---------------
> Air|**Lesser Air Elemental**
> Earth|**Lesser Earth Elemental**
> Fire|**Lesser Fire Elemental**
> Harmony|**Ancient Spirit** (any)
> Life|***Beast*** *or* ***Plant*** (any, CR 2 or below)
> Mana|**Arcane Wyrm** *or* **Lesser Arcane Elemental**
> Shadow|**Voidwalker**
> Water|**Lesser Water Elemental**
