## Dragon

Dragons are immense, powerful, winged reptilian creatures, created from proto-dragons by the titans and the Keepers to safeguard the world of Azeroth millennia ago. They are divided into several types called dragonflights.

***Immense Power.*** The dragons of Azeroth reach maturity after a mere hundred years have passed. They are very cunning and magical, using spells to complement their powerful physical capacity. Because each creature has an intimate connection with the world around it, the death of a dragon is never a simple thing; it is a metaphysical event, driven by the creature's natural connection to the spirit of the world. 

***Dragon's Death.*** A dragon's death can cause massive upheaval in the natural surroundings — earthquakes, surface lava explosions, a new lake flooding forth from a sudden crack in the earth‘s crust, and so on. Even young dragons, those who have not established as close a bond to the spiritual world, still make ripples in the fabric of reality when they die. Although these ripples are not always seen or felt by other races, a young dragon's death nonetheless garners the attention of other dragons in the area — and creatures particularly attuned to the natural state of being that surrounds them.

### DragonWhelps
Dragon whelps are the smallest members of the dragonkin species. They are the youngest and weakest variation of dragons adventurers face. In most cases however, where there are whelps, their larger cousins are close by. 

### Dragonspawns
Dragonspawn are monstrous beings trained to serve under the five dragonflights of the world, and some say they evolved from humans who dedicated their lives to servitude under the great dragons.

### Drakonids
Drakonid are mortals empowered by the dragons they serve, via intentional alteration or via "unintended side effect of hanging out with dragons". The process does not have to be willing. Each drakonid seems to have a fatal weakness to one magic type, making it suffer enormous damage from that particular school.

### Drakes
Drakes are dragons that are still relatively young in comparison to their ancient brethren. Drakes are almost always flying while moving, while nether drakes tend to walk.

### Proto-Dragons
The proto-dragons were the ancestors of dragons before they evolved into the sapient, beautiful majestic creatures that they are known as today.

## Green Dragonflight
The green dragonflight (or the Emerald Dragonflight) consists of dragons with green scales. During the ordering of Azeroth, the titan Eonar charged Ysera and her flight with the protection of the natural world and the Emerald Dream, a pristine realm of nature and magic. Thus, green dragons have an affinity for animals and nature.

***Protectors of Nature.*** Like the red dragonflight, green dragons are generally more approachable than those of other flights, primarily coming into conflict only with those who attempt to corrupt or destroy nature. They occasionally sought the help of druids to aid in this task.

## Red Dragonflight

The red dragonflight are dragons that have red scales and breath fire. Their fire can either destroy or bring life. They are led by Alexstrasza the Life-Binder. The titan Eonar charged Alexstrasza with protecting life. 

***Protectors of Life.*** The red dragons generally wish to protect all life on Azeroth as their queen does, while battling those who wish to do the world harm. In particular, the Black dragonflight and their Twilight aberrations served as the red dragon's foremost enemies. Despite their mission, some red dragons hold a mistrust, even animosity, towards mortals because of the events of the Second War.

## Infinite Dragonflight
The infinite dragonflight (or simply the Infinites) is a dragonflight formed from corrupted members of the bronze dragonflight. 

Their only goal is seemingly to destroy the one true timeway and to help the Old Gods bring about the Hour of Twilight. Their reasons for doing so are not entirely clear, but it is hinted at that it is to stop an even worse fate. The infinites are led by Murozond, the future corrupted version of the bronze Aspect Nozdormu.

## Netherwing Dragonflight

The Netherwing Dragonflight is an unorthodox brood of ethereal dragons whose bodies are composed of energies from the Twisting Nether. 

The Netherwing dragonflight can trace its origins back to eggs of the black dragonflight taken through the Dark Portal by Deathwing, which were accidentally exposed to a great deal of nether energies when Draenor was torn apart. Free of any bonds to their parent dragonflight, the netherwings now seek a new life in the turbulent, and often hostile, the world of Outland.

## Plagued Dragonflight

The Cult of the Damned began breeding a plagued dragonflight within Scholomance as another method of spreading the Plague of Undeath. 

The necromancers of Scholomance, working under Vectus, used black dragon eggs from the Burning Steppes as the basis for their experiments, and hopes to unleash the plagued dragons on the world. However, the Argent Dawn has caught wind of their activities and plans, and is working to destroy the abominable plagued dragons before they can be deployed.

## Stone Dragonflight

The mighty stone dragons are mysterious creatures that inhabit Deepholm, the elemental plane of earth. Their origin is unknown, as before the Shattering no one had seen them (or lived long enough to tell the story). 

Their draconic appearance, however, may not indicate their true nature. It appears they are quite tightly connected to the element of earth, although they are not aligned with Therazane. As stated by the Kor the Immovable, the stone dragons are fickle, and bend only to strength and the strongest of them is Aeosera, their broodmother.

## Storm Dragonflight

The Storm Dragonflight are dragons possessing the power of the storms and who make their lairs in the mountain peaks of both Stormheim and Suramar.

***Mysterious Ancestry.*** Their origins are unknown; if they were once proto-drakes native to Azeroth they may have been altered by the titans, as the Dragon Aspects were at one point. It is also entirely likely that they are pure elemental beings and not flesh and blood dragons at all.
