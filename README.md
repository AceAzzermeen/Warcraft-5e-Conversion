# Warcraft: Heroes' Handbook

### Branching Structure

This project uses a slightly different take on [feature branching](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Being an RPG book, the branches focus on where in the book changes are being made, amd what changes they are. 

`<topic>/<branch-name>`

The `<topic>/` of the branch should be the section of the book affected. The `<branch-name>` should summarise the specific part being changed.

The following are good examples of branch names for the project:

* `race/orc-traits`

* `spell/mage-spell-list`

* `class/rebalance-warrior-features`
