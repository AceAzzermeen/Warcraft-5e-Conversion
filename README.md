# Warcraft: Heroes' Handbook

### Branching Structure

This project uses a slightly different take on [feature branching](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Being an RPG book, the branches focus on where in the book changes are being made, amd what changes they are. 

`<topic>/<branch-name>`

The `<topic>/` of the branch should be the section of the book affected. The `<branch-name>` should summarise the specific part being changed.

The following are good examples of branch names for the project:

* `race/orc-traits`

* `spell/mage-spell-list`

* `class/rebalance-warrior-features`

## Warcraft: Manual of Monsters

Progress on the Manual of Monsters is kept in its own Drive spreadsheet. Creatures are put aside in chunks for smaller, reachable milestones and then signed off on when the stats have been set and agreed upon.

#### Adding Creatures to the Project

New creature statblocks for the Manual of Monsters are added to their own WIP folder first, and then pulled from there into the book. That way we can scope the book into iterations, and extra statblocks can be done parallel with book formatting.
