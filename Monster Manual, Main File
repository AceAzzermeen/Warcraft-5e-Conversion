## Foreword </div>
We've made this book in an attempt to bring the beloved Warcraft franchise into the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. It is a task that has taken us months to do, and many more to come as we continue to work on this in our spare time, in the hopes of bringing a genuine recreation of Warcraft into a tabletop game.

This book is made to compliment Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition **Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide**, and **Monster Manuals**. Using the rules presented in those books, and balanced around being playable in a standard D&D setting without requiring balancing.

This books is made in our spare time with the intention of always being a free resource for everyone to use. Never to be bought or paid for. We've made this because we want others to enjoy the Warcraft universe in a Dungeons & Dragons format. Not for any monetary gain.

With each coming update, all changes will be noted in the Changelog--Link is provided below. Likewise we've provided a link to our racial balance shreadsheet, using the rules of Detect Balance by  Eleazzaar.

Thanks for Reading

I've had a love for the Warcraft franchise since I was young, and have followed it closely for years at this point. Wasn't long after I got into D&D that I thought to myself that playing D&D in the Warcraft universe would be a blast.

This has been a blast to make, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope it brings enjoyment to many D&D tables across the world. Best of luck to all the parties of human and orc, try not to chop each other too much up ;)
