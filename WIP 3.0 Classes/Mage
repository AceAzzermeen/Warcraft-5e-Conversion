## Mage
*Always remember that power is a double-edged blade. One side light, the other dark. It calls to you, where you are most desperate; when victory seems worth any sacrifice. There is a price to be paid for such a gift, and many eagerly accept the bargain. Power alone is not to be feared. <br>Fear, instead, those who wield it.*
<div style="text-align:Right">

*— Jaina Proudmoore* &nbsp;</div>

Clad in a golden robe, a blood elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefields and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into an engulfing conflagration.

The air shimmers, as a draenei lifts his hands above his head twisting the air around him into a barrier of force engulfs him, blocking a barrage of attacks against him.

Golden eyes flashing, a human stomps his foot into the ground as a crippling fire sets him ablaze, as swords clash against him, an inferno of fire spews out at the attackers, engulfing them in hellfire.

Mages are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the leylines of magic that permeates Azeroth, mages cast spells of explo-sive fire, arcing lightning, and subtle deception. Their magic can conjure monsters from other planes of exis-tence, or glimpses the future. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals across continents.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:317px'></div>

### Masters of Time and Space
Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The arcane magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, mages wear only cloth armor, but arcane shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, mages can summon bursts of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, setting groups of foes ablaze. Masters of ice can command blizzards that tear into flesh and limit movement. Should enemies manage to survive this assault, mages can shrink them into harmless sheep in the blink of an eye.

Powerful magi can even generate enhancements and portals, assisting allies by sharpening their minds and transporting them instantly across the world.

### Scholars of the Arcane
Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the titans, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.

Mages live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other mages, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures that are steeped in magic.

### The Lure of Knowledge
Mages' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a mage is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous mages out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most mages believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

### Creating a Mage
Creating a mage character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?

What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other mages?

#### Optional Rule: Multiclassing
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the *Player's Handbook*, here's what you need to know if you choose mage as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a mage.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If mage isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a mage: arcane skill.

***Spell Slots.*** Add your levels in the mage class to the appropriate levels from other class to determine your available spell slots.

#### Quick Build
You can make a mage quickly by following these sugges-tions. First, lntelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity.

## Class Features
As a mage, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per mage level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per mage level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** None
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons
- **Tools:** None
___
- **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom
- **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
 - *(a)* quarterstaff or *(b)* a dagger
 - *(a)* a component pouch or *(b)* an arcane focus

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

<br>

 - *(a)* a scholar's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
 - A spellbook

### Spellcasting
As a student of arcane, you own a spellbook with spells that show the glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 of Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the mage spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the mage spell list. You learn additional mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mage table.

<div style='margin-top:30px;'></div>

> ##### Your Spellbook
> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell re-corded on a scroll in an evil sorcerer's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
>
> ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a mage spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
>
> Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the mage who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.
>
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.
>
> ***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book — for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spell&shy;book, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
>
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. The remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. Many mages keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
>
> ***The Book's Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorations and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you re-ceived as a gift, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

\columnbreak

#### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level mage spells of your choice. Your spellbook does not contain your known cantrips.
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of mage spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of mage spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your mage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example. if you're a 3rd-level mage, you have four <br> 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of mage spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memori-zing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your mage spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Intelligence modifier
</div>
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a mage spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your mage spells.
<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a mage level, you add two mage spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Mage table. On your adventurers, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the "Your Spellbook" sidebar).

### Arcane Recovery
You learn to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your mage level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be of 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level mage, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Magical Study
Starting at 2nd level, you choose a magical study, shaping your practice of magic through one of three areas: Arcane, Fire or Frost, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Metamagic
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. When you use your Metamagic, you choose which effect to twist your spell with. You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted and when you use a metamagic option, you can't use that option again until you finishg a long rest.

#### Accurate Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that hits only one creature, to give yourself advantage on the spell attack roll.

#### Careful Spell
You can use your metamagic to protect creatures from your spells saving throw. Choose a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.

#### Empowered Spell
You can use your metamagic when you roll damage for a spell to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You must then use the new damage rolls.

#### Extended Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

#### Distant Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater to double the range of the spell.

You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that has a range of touch to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

#### Persistent Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that targets only one creature and requires a saving throw, to give the creature disadvantage on the saving throw.

#### Quickened Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action to cast it as a bonus action.

#### Ricocheting Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell that targets only one creature and another creature is within 5 feet of it, to make the damage of your spell ricochet and hit both. The second target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save it takes half damage, and no damage on a successful save. It is not affected by any other effects of the spell.

#### Subtle Spell
You can use your metamagic when you cast a spell to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

\columnbreak

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2. or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Spell Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level mage spell and a 2nd-level mage spell that are in your spell&shy;book. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

You can spend 8 hours in study, and change one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same level.

### Signature Spells
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over <br> two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. <br> Choose two 3rd-level mage spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

## Magical Studies
Mages are spellcasters who favor magics involving the cardinal elements of the universe. Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The magic available to mages is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted practitioners.

### Study of Arcane
Mages of the arcane are diviners of secrets, balancing the webb and flow of incredible mystic energies. These practi-tioners push their magical knowledge to its very limits. Those who master this craft are capable of releasing a barrage of unrelenting power upon their enemies.

#### Transmutation Savant
Beginning when you select this study at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Magic Resonance
Starting at 2nd level, whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot, you gain an arcane charge. You can accumulate a number of arcane charges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Your arcane charges last until expended, or until the end of your next long rest.

You can use your action and expend all arcane charges to unleash a barrage of arcane magic. For each arcane charge expended, make a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet of you that you can see. On a hit, a target takes force damage equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Arcane Brilliance
Upon reaching 6th level, you gain proficiency in arcana <br> if you don't already have it and your proficiency bonus doubles for any ability check you make with it.

Additionally, you are always under the effects of a *comprehend languages* spell.

#### Prismatic Barrier
Starting at 10th level, you can siphon arcane energy <br> from harmful effects to your own benefit. You can use your reaction when you are forced to make a saving throw against magic to give yourself advantage on the save. On a failed save, you suffer the spells effect, but take only half damage (if any). On a success&shy;ful save, you take no damage from the spell and gain one arcane charge.

### Study of Fire
While any worthy mage is an unparalleled expert in the use of magic and heavily dedicated to their craft, those who master the forces of fire tend to be a little more audacious than their peers. These mages take pride, even pleasure in igniting their enemies in wild bursts of flame.

#### Evocation Savant
Beginning when you select this study at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Hot Streak
Starting at 2nd level, the blazing energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.

At 10th level, you may choose any number of dice that rolled the highest number possible, you can only reroll each dice once.

#### Cauterize
Beginning at 6th level, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to draw on the fiery energy that burn within you. You are instead reduced to 1 hit point, and each creature within 10 feet of you takes fire damage equal to half your mage level + your Intelligence modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Empowered Evocation
Upon reaching 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage roll of any mage evocation spell that you cast. The damage bonus applies to one damage roll of a spell, not multiple rolls.

#### Combustion
At 14th level, you can unleash the flames that blaze within you. As an action, you wreathing yourself in swirling fire. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

 - You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
 - Any creature takes fire damage equal to half your mage level if it hits you with a melee attack.
 - Any spell or effect you create ignores resistance to fire damage and treats immunity to fire damage as resistance to fire damage.
 - Your spell attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Study of Frost
Frost mages stand apart from their colleagues, in that their chosen school of magic focuses on maintaining supreme control over the capabilities of their enemies. Mages who command frost perform chilling displays on the battlefield, rendering foes immobile as they bombard them with ice.

#### Conjuration Savant
Beginning when you select this study at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Fingers of Frost
Starting at 2nd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice:

***Ice Barrier.*** You can weave the cold around yourself for protection. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals cold damage to a creature, you can simultaneously warp part of the spell's magic to create an icy barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The barrier has hit points equal to twice your mage level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If the damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

When the barrier is reduced to 0 hit point, each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have their speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn as the barrier bursts.

While the barrier has 0 hit points, it cant absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals cold damage, the barrier regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

Once you create the barrier, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

***Water Elemental.*** You learn how to conjure a water elemental. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See the creature's game statistics in the water elemental stat block.

In combat, the water elemental shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, or Help action.

If you target the water elemental with a spell that deals cold damage, it is considered immune to the damage and regains a number of hit points equal to it. You don't need to roll to hit your elemental and it automatically fails any saving throw for it if you choose it.

At the end of a long rest, you can conjure a new water elemental. If you already have a water elemental from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.

#### Brain Freeze
Beginning at 6th level, whenever you deal cold damage to a creature with a mage spell, it must succeed on a Constitu&shy;tion saving throw or have its movement speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn as it becomes *chilled*.

When you deal cold damage to a *chilled* creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be grappled until the end of your next turn as it becomes *frozen*.

You have advantage on any spell attack you make against a *frozen* creature. If you successful hit a frozen creature the ice around it shatters and returns its speed to normal.

#### Hands of Frost
Upon reaching 10th level, you gain one of the following features, depending on your choice at 2nd level.

***Ice Barrier.*** When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Ice Barrier to manifest around it and absorb the damage. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the barricaded creature takes any remaining damage.

In addition, a creature who fails the saving throw when your ice barrier bursts becomes *chilled.*
